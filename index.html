                  In reponse to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) and the
                  Kisan Mazdoor Morcha’s ongoing “Delhi Chalo” agitation, Union
                  Ministers Arjun Munda, Piyush Goyal and Nityanand Rai will
                  meet farmer representatives in Chandigarh on February 15. A
                  virtual meeting was held between the farmers and
                  representatives from the central government on February 14.
                  The protest was started to pressure on the BJP-led Centre for
                  farmers’ demands, including a law on a minimum support price
                  (MSP) for crops and loan waivers. The Centre had made it clear
                  that announcing a guaranteed MSP will not be possible.

                <p>
                  Haldwani, India – At about 6:45pm on February 8, Mohammad Arif
                  called his brother Zahid. A mosque and an Islamic school had
                  been razed by government officials in their town of Haldwani
                  in northern India, and violence had broken out. The
                  52-year-old Arif wanted his brother, seven years younger, to
                  return home immediately from the iron and cement shop he
                  worked in. Zahid rushed home on his motorbike and parked it
                  outside the house. Unaware that the protest had become
                  violent, Zahid hurried to buy milk for his infant grandchild.

                <p>
                  Amid a stand-off with the farmers, who are protesting with
                  their demands, Haryana Police in Ambala District has said that
                  any loss to the government and private property during the
                  protest will be compensated by attaching the property and
                  seizure of bank accounts of the protestors. According to a
                  release from the Ambala police, from February 13, 2024,
                  continuous efforts are being made by the farmer organizations
                  to break the barricade imposed on Shambhu Border by the
                  farmers regarding their march to Delhi and daily attempts are
                  being made to spoil the law and order by pelting stones at the
                  police administration and creating ruckus. During this period,
                  a lot of damage has been caused to government and private
                  property by encroachment. "The damage caused to government and
                  private property by the agitators is being assessed. The
                  administration had already informed/warned in this regard that
                  if the agitators caused damage to government and private
                  property during this movement, then this loss would be
                  compensated by seizing their property and bank accounts. If
                  public property is damaged by the agitators during the
                  movement, there is an amendment in the Prevention of Damage to
                  Public Property Act 1984 (PDPP Act) under the provisions of
                  the Supreme Court in which, the people who caused damage to
                  public property during the movement or called for the movement
                  and the officials of that organization are held responsible
                  for any damage caused," the official release said.

                <h1>Biden Meets Putin Critic Navalny's Family In California</h1>
                <p>
                  San Francisco: President Joe Biden had a private, emotional
                  meeting with the widow and daughter of Alexei Navalny in
                  California on Thursday, as his administration announced fresh
                  sanctions against Russia over the death of the Kremlin
                  opposition leader. The visit at a hotel in San Francisco came
                  as the White House backed Navalny's mother in her fight to
                  retrieve her son's body, which Russian authorities have
                  refused to release days after he died in an Arctic
                  prison.Navalny's team says the 47-year-old, President Vladimir
                  Putin's most outspoken critic, was murdered. Biden could be
                  seen hugging Yulia Navalnaya, Navalny's widow, and leaning
                  forward as he spoke with her and daughter Dasha, a student at
                  Stanford University, in images released by the White House.
