                        A virtual meeting was held between the farmers and representatives from the central government on February 14.
                        
                        The protest was started to pressure on the BJP-led Centre for farmers’ demands, including a law on a minimum support price (MSP) for crops and loan waivers. The Centre had made it clear that announcing a guaranteed MSP will not be possible. </p>

                    <p>Haldwani, India – At about 6:45pm on February 8, Mohammad Arif called his brother Zahid. A mosque and an Islamic school had been razed by government officials in their town of Haldwani in northern India, and violence had broken out. The 52-year-old Arif wanted his brother, seven years younger, to return home immediately from the iron and cement shop he worked in.
    
                    Zahid rushed home on his motorbike and parked it outside the house. Unaware that the protest had become violent, Zahid hurried to buy milk for his infant grandchild.</p>
